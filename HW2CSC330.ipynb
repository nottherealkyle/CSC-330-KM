As a result, since it can only run 5 inference steps the model can barely sculpt an image from the noise, leading to the generated image being sloppy and blurry.\n",

        "    2. In trial C, the image became too bright and oversaturated. This is because the higher CFG makes the model adhere to the prompt more closely, making it lose creativity in its generation and making the image less appealing due to the model trying to follow every word of the prompt.\n",
